# Hybrid Body Suit

The **Hybrid Body Suit** is an assistive wearable designed to improve indoor navigation, spatial awareness, and safety for individuals with visual impairments or mobility challenges. It combines a **haptic vest** and **smart glasses** equipped with AI and a depth-sensing camera to provide real-time feedback about the user’s surroundings.


# Features

- **Depth Estimation & Object Detection**  
  Smart glasses use computer vision to estimate distances to obstacles, staircases, and railings.

- **Haptic Feedback Vest**  
  Vibrating motors provide directional cues, helping the user avoid collisions and stay oriented.

- **Multi-Directional Awareness**  
  Sensors cover front, sides, and back, allowing multiple zones to alert simultaneously.

- **Crowd-Safe Feedback Control**  
  A "Static Object Timeout" feature pauses haptics if an obstacle remains in the same position for more than 5 seconds, resuming when there’s a change.

- **Flexible Mounting**  
  Glasses module can be worn on eyeglass frames, headbands, or hats for comfort and stability.

# Use Cases

- Navigating unfamiliar indoor environments  
- Detecting open staircases without risers  
- Staying centered on a walkway or near railings  
- Avoiding collisions in crowded spaces

# Safety Notes

- This device is a **navigation aid** and should not replace a white cane or guide dog.  
- Test thoroughly in controlled environments before public use.  
- The haptic feedback should be set to a comfortable, non-painful intensity.
